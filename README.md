#Exploratory Analysis of Stock Data and CAPM Metrics
Problem Description:
In this project, the goal is to perform an exploratory analysis of historical stock price data for a selection of stocks. The project aims to analyze and visualize key metrics related to stock performance, risk, and market trends. Specifically, the project focuses on the following tasks:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Collect historical price data for a set of selected stocks (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL).
Prepare the data by cleaning and formatting it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Calculate basic statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for stock prices.
Visualize the trends and patterns in stock prices using line charts or candlestick charts.
Examine the volatility of stock prices over time.
Normalization and Comparison:

Normalize stock prices to understand relative performance.
Visualize the normalized stock prices to compare the performance of different stocks.
CAPM Analysis:

Calculate the Beta coefficient for each stock using CAPM.
Interpret the Beta values to assess the systematic risk of each stock.
Visualize the relationship between each stock's Beta and its historical performance.
